        What is jBPM? <br>
        jBPM is a toolkit for building business applications to help automate business processes and decisions.

        jBPM originates from BPM (Business Process Management) but it has evolved to enable users to pick their own path in business automation. It provides various capabilities that simplify and externalize business logic into reusable assets such as cases, processes, decision tables and more.

        business processes (BPMN2)
        case management (BPMN2 and CMMN)
        decision management (DMN)
        business rules (DRL)
        business optimisation (Solver)
        jBPM can be used as standalone service or embedded in custom service. It does not mandate any of the frameworks to be used, it can be successfully used in

        traditional JEE applications - war/ear deployments
        SpringBoot or Thorntail (formerly known as WildFly Swarm) - uberjar deployments
        standalone java programs
        jBPM is typically used to build business applications. A business application could be defined as a domain-specific solution (built with selected frameworks and capabilities) that solves a particular business problem. To implement the business logic it leverages capabilities from various frameworks like business processes, business rules and planning constraints, but also persistence, messaging, transactions, etc.
