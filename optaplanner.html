        What is OptaPlanner? <br>
        <em>OptaPlanner</em> is an AI constraint solver. It optimizes planning and scheduling problems, such as the Vehicle 
        Routing Problem, Employee Rostering, Maintenance Scheduling, Task Assignment, School Timetabling, Cloud 
        Optimization, Conference Scheduling, Job Shop Scheduling, Bin Packing and many more. Every organization 
        faces such challenges: assign a limited set of constrained resources (employees, assets, time and/or money) 
        to provide products or services. OptaPlanner delivers more efficient plans, which reduce costs and improve 
        service quality.

        OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine. It enables everyday Java programmers to solve 
        optimization problems efficiently. It is also compatible with other JVM languages (such as Kotlin and Scala). 
        Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can call existing code. There’s no need to input constraints as 
        mathematical equations. Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated Artificial Intelligence optimization 
        algorithms (such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Late Acceptance and other metaheuristics) with very 
        efficient score calculation and other state-of-the-art constraint solving techniques.

        OptaPlanner is open source software, released under the Apache License. 
        It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any JVM and is available in the Maven Central repository too. 
        It works with Quarkus and Spring Boot.
